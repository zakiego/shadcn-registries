## Registries Index

- Data source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadcn-ui/ui/refs/heads/main/apps/v4/public/r/registries.json`
- Shape: `Record<string, string>` where key is the registry (e.g. `@shadcn-editor`) and value is a URL template containing `{name}`.

### UI Behavior

- Index page fetches and lists registries as cards.
- Card shows the registry key and the template URL.
- Card is a single clickable link to the registry homepage (origin of the template URL).
- Search input filters by registry name, template URL, or hostname.
- Responsive grid: 1/2/3/4 columns across breakpoints.
- Source link: A "Source JSON" badge under the page description opens the raw JSON in a new tab. Visible on loading, error, and loaded states.

### Files

- `src/routes/index.tsx`: Fetch + render cards.
- `src/components/Header.tsx`: Simplified to only show Home.

### Future Enhancements

- Copy template URL.
- Choose sample `{name}` (default `button`).

### Homepage Overrides

Some registries have friendlier landing pages than their raw origin. We override the computed homepage (`new URL(template).origin + '/'`) for specific origins.

Current overrides:

- `https://registry.ai-sdk.dev` â†’ `https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/overview`
